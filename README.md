## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was just a practice of what I already know.
Mostly I remembered how to use media queries.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /* ... */
}
```

### Continued development

I will try more challenging projects and practice js frameworks (mostly [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)).
